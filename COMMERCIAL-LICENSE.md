# Commercial License for Redirect0

If you want to use Redirect0 for commercial purposes, you need to purchase a commercial license.

## Why a Commercial License?

The Redirect0 software is available under both the AGPL-3.0 open source license and this commercial license. The AGPL-3.0 license is perfect for:

- Personal use
- Educational use
- Non-commercial projects
- Open source projects that can comply with AGPL-3.0

However, if you're using Redirect0 in a commercial setting and don't want to open source your entire application (as potentially required by AGPL-3.0), you'll need a commercial license.

## What's Included in the Commercial License

- Permission to use Redirect0 in commercial products without the need to open source your code
- Priority support
- Access to additional premium features (coming soon)
